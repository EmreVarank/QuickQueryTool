# ChatGPT Quick Query Tool

This Python script allows you to instantly send selected text to the ChatGPT app with a single key press and get an explanation. If you come across something you don't understand, are curious about, or want to research further - simply select the text and press P â€” the script takes care of the rest.

- Make sure ChatGPT is installed on your system.

- Update the GPT_EXECUTABLE_PATH in the script according to your installation.
